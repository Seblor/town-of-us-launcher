<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This program provides a simple, out-of-the-box way to install and run the Town of Use mod. This targets 2 types of people:
- Those who do not want to edit the game files themselves
- Those who do not want to bother switching back and forth between modded and unmodded Among Us

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Usage

Go to the [last release page](https://github.com/Seblor/town-of-us-launcher/releases/latest), download the executable file, and simply run it !

The Steam version of the game will still be the base game (without any mods installed), and this program will run the modded game, and handle the update if it detects a new version of the game installed by Steam or a new version of the mod. (Please ensure that the Among Us game is always up to date to properly handle the update)

### Prerequisites

This program requires Steam and the base Among Us installed on the computer.

Although it should not be mandatory, it is preferable to have Steam open when rnning the program.

### Troubleshooting

If any problem occurs, try the following steps:
1. delete the `%appdata%/TownOfUs` folder
2. Make sure the game is up to date
3. Check the game files integrity ([you can click here to do that](steam://validate/945360))
4. run the launcher again.

If that didn't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Seblor/town-of-us-launcher/issues)
